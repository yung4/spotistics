Spotistics, a portmanteau of 'Spotify' and 'Statistics,' is a ReactJS application that utilizes the Spotify Web API to show a user's listening habits. The app shows a user's top artists and tracks for a certain period of time, a breakdown of each playlist, and their play history. 

Even though these types of applications have been created before, I wanted to combine aesthetics with functionality, along with having the fulfillment of creating a project that people can use. Working on Spotistics gave me experience with a multitude of industry standards, such as the React App framework, NodeJS, jQuery and AJAX, Bootstrap, and much more.
